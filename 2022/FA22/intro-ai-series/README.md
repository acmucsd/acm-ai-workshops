    Mandatory Sections:
        - File Directory Structure
        - Getting Started
            - Give an interesting description of your workshop!
            - E.g. you can use the marketing descriptiong (w/o the emojis
              and make the nouns general ('you' becomes 'the reader'))
        - Resources
            - Images, papers, etc
    Other Possible Sections:
        - Datasets
            - Separate from 'Resources' to distinguish between inspiration and
              things like datasets used in a notebook
        - Anything else you'd like, but try not to be redundant!

# 2. Getting Started

## 2.1 Workshop 1 - Intro to AI: Search Algorithms

<!-- 
    You can write something up for each worksop or use their marketing descriptions.
-->

Interested in learning about the core algorithms behind Artificial Intelligence and Decision-Making? ðŸ§  Come to our 1st of 3 Intro to AI Workshops this quarter! In this workshop, we will cover Search algorithms for Informed and Uninformed Search in a Game Environment ðŸ‘¾. This workshop will include an interactive Google Colab Notebook for you to code along with us, and by the end, you will have built an AI agent that learns to search in its environment! 

Slides: https://acmurl.com/ai-search-slides

## 2.2 Workshop 2 - Intro to AI: Multi-Agent Search

<!-- 
    You can write something up for each worksop or use their marketing descriptions.
-->

Interested in learning about the core algorithms behind Artificial Intelligence and Decision-Making? ðŸ§  Come to our 2nd of 3 Intro to AI Workshops this quarter! In this workshop, we will cover Multi-Agent Search algorithms like Minimax and Expectimax in a Game Environment ðŸ‘¾. This workshop will include an interactive Google Colab Notebook for you to code along with us, and by the end, you will have built an AI agent that learns to do multi-agent search in its environment to win a game!
