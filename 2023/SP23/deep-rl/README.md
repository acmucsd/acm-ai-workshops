The official ACM AI "Deep Reinforcement Learning" repository.

**Description**: Join us for an immersive workshop on **Deep Reinforcement Learning** (DRL), a cutting-edge approach for solving complex decision-making problems that is revolutionizing artificial intelligence. This workshop and repository will provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental concepts, techniques, and applications of Deep RL.

We will cover the following set of topics:

1. Reinforcement Learning Framework
    - Types of Tasks
    - Exploration and Exploitation
    - 2 Main Approaches for solving problems with RL
2. From Q-Learning to Deep Q-Learning
    - Q-Learning Algorithm
    - Q-Learning Example
    - Deep Q-Network (DQN)
    - Deep Q Algorithm
    - Deep Q-Network Example
3. Beyond Deep Q-Learning
    - Overview of popular Deep RL algorithms
    - Successful (and un-successful) Applications of Deep RL
    - Open problems in Deep RL Research

    Mandatory Sections:
        - File Directory Structure
        - Workshop Recording
            - if you recorded your workshop, please make it available here
        - Getting Started
            - Give an interesting description of your workshop!
            - E.g. you can use the marketing descriptiong (w/o the emojis
              and make the nouns general ('you' becomes 'the reader'))
        - Resources
            - Images, papers, etc
        - Author Info
            - About yourself! This is so you get credit for your work!
    Other Possible Sections:
        - Datasets
            - Separate from 'Resources' to distinguish between inspiration and
              things like datasets used in a notebook
        - Anything else you'd like, but try not to be redundant!

    Most, if not all, workshops should have recordings. Once the recording
    is posted to the ACMUCSD YT channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyjPATFqc3FwOiuqJ2UG1Eg),
    replace the text with an <img> element.
