    Mandatory Sections:
        - File Directory Structure
        - Getting Started
            - Give an interesting description of your workshop!
            - E.g. you can use the marketing descriptiong (w/o the emojis
              and make the nouns general ('you' becomes 'the reader'))

            - Images, papers, etc
    Other Possible Sections:
        - Datasets
            - Separate from 'Resources' to distinguish between inspiration and
              things like datasets used in a notebook
        - Anything else you'd like, but try not to be redundant!

# 2. Getting Started

## 2.1 Workshop 1 - Intro to CV: Pytorch and Image Classification

<!-- 
    You can write something up for each workshop or use their marketing descriptions.
-->

Interested in learning about Computer Vision - teaching computers to process and classify images? Come to our 1st of 2 Intro to CV Workshops this quarter! In this workshop, participants will receive a code-focused, interactive introduction to Pytorch, Neural Networks, and Image Classification in MNIST. Make sure to bring a computer, as we will have interactive notebooks for participants to code along with the presenters.

## 2.2 Workshop 2 - Intro to CV: Convolutional Neural Networks

<!-- 
    You can write something up for each workshop or use their marketing descriptions.
-->

Interested in learning about Computer Vision - teaching computers to process and classify images? Come to our 2nd of 2 Intro to CV Workshops this quarter! Building on the previous workshops, we will transform a typical neural network into a CNN made specifically for computer vision. Make sure to bring a computer, as we will have interactive notebooks for participants to code in Pytorch along with the presenters.
