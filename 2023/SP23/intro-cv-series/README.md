# 2. Getting Started

## 2.1 Workshop 1 - Intro to CV: Pytorch and Neural Networks

<!-- 
    You can write something up for each worksop or use their marketing descriptions.
-->

An introduction to Pytorch, basic machine learning formulations, and neural networks. This workshop will lead students through developing a multi layer neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, and provide the foundation and intuitions for students to begin tackling basic computer vision problems on their own, and empower their own learning.
