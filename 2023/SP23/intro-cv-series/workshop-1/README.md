## 3 Getting Started

Interested in learning about Computer Vision - teaching computers to process and classify images? Come to our 1st of 3 Intro to CV Workshops this quarter! In this workshop, participants will receive a code-focused, interactive introduction to Pytorch, Neural Networks, and Image Classification in MNIST. Make sure to bring a computer, as we will have interactive notebooks for participants to code along with the presenters.

Workshop 1 consists of 3 components:
- [Presentation](./Slides_Intro_to_CV_Workshop_1_Getting_Started_with_Computer_Vision.pdf) used during the workshop.
- [Main Notebook](./Main_Notebook_Intro_to_CV_Workshop_1_Getting_Started_with_Computer_Vision.ipynb) with completed code and explanations.
- [Interactive Notebook](./Interactive_Notebook_Intro_to_CV_Workshop_1_Getting_Started_with_Computer_Vision.ipynb) with questions and exercises for the reader.

<!-- 
    Note: The above list will depend on your specific workshop.
