# 1. Workshop Recording

Unfortunately, due to last-minute glitches in software, a recording was not made for this workshop. We apologize for the inconvenience. However, the [presentation](./Slides_Intro_to_CV_Workshop_2_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_CNNs.pdf) and [Colab Notebook](./Notebook_Intro_to_CV_Workshop_2_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_CNNs.ipynb) have all necessary content explained in the workshop.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask in out [ACM AI Discord](https://discord.gg/SZA2WV36sJ); we're happy to help!

# 3. Getting Started

Interested in learning about Computer Vision - teaching computers to process and classify images? Come to our 2nd of 3 Intro to CV Workshops this quarter! Building on the previous workshops, we will transform a typical neural network into a CNN made specifically for computer vision. Make sure to bring a computer, as we will have interactive notebooks for participants to code in Pytorch along with the presenters.

Workshop 1 consists of 2 components:
- [Presentation](./Slides_Intro_to_CV_Workshop_2_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_CNNs.pdf) used during the workshop.
- [Colab Notebook](./Notebook_Intro_to_CV_Workshop_2_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_CNNs.ipynb) with completed code and explanations.

<!-- 
    Note: The above list will depend on your specific workshop.
