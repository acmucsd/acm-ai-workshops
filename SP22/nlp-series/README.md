# 3. Getting Started

## 3.1. Workshop 1: Basics of NLP

Have you ever wondered how Siri learns your interests, or how Twitter filters hate speech? ACM AI’s Natural Language Processing (NLP) Workshop series is a series of interactive, in-person demos covering the ins and outs of NLP!  In our first workshop, we’ll learn the uses and practice the basics of NLP through interactive Colab notebooks that you can bring home to experiment with. By the end, you’ll know how to apply the models you learn to classify any text you want.

## 3.2. Workshop 2: RNNs for Multiclassification

This workshop is about Recurrent Neural Networks for NLP for detecting emotions in a multi-class dataset. This workshop is self-contained from the first and covers RNNs from the ground up!

## 3.3. Workshop 3: Seq2Seq for Machine Translation

Language Translation is a ubiquitous topic of Modern Natural Language Processing, and the AI that powers language translation is critical to creating a world where we can break down communication barriers between communities that speak different languages.

By the end of this workshop, the reader will have a working Language Translation model similar to Google Translate!

## 4.1 Workshop 1

Each of the following covers a similar topic to our first workshop:
- [Melanie Walsh Text Analysis Tutorial](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/05-Text-Analysis/04-Sentiment-Analysis.html#) 
- [NeuromatchAcademy's Text Analysis Tutorial](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content-dl/tree/main/tutorials)
- [Arth's Inspirit AI Colab Notebooks](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y7R_lD8-OAyMD6oecoShiDl23ke5Nai0)

## 4.2 Workshop 2

We base our second workshop on the following notebook:
- [Emotion Classification (NLP)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dorgavra/emotion-classification-nlp/notebook) by Dor Gavra

## 4.3 Workshop 3

We base our code on the following example tutorial:
- [Keras NLP Character-Level Seq2Seq RNN Model](https://keras.io/examples/nlp/lstm_seq2seq/)

We also base many of our explanations on the following resources:
- [*Encoder-Decoder Seq2Seq Models, Clearly Explained!!*](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/encoder-decoder-seq2seq-models-clearly-explained-c34186fbf49b) by Kriz Moses
- [*A Simple Introduction to Sequence to Sequence Models*](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/08/a-simple-introduction-to-sequence-to-sequence-models/#:~:text=Sequence%20to%20Sequence%20) from Analytics Vidhya
- [*What is Teacher Forcing for Recurrent Neural Networks?*](https://machinelearningmastery.com/teacher-forcing-for-recurrent-neural-networks/) by Jason Brownlee
- [*Understanding LSTM Networks*](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) by Christopher Olah for [NLPW3_Fig4a](./workshop-3/figures/NLPW3_Fig4a.png)
