# 3. Getting Started

## 3.1. Workshop 1 Basics of NLP

Have you ever wondered how Siri learns your interests, or how Twitter filters hate speech? ACM AI’s Natural Language Processing (NLP) Workshop series is a series of interactive, in-person demos covering the ins and outs of NLP!  In our first workshop, we’ll learn the uses and practice the basics of NLP through interactive Colab notebooks that you can bring home to experiment with. By the end, you’ll know how to apply the models you learn to classify any text you want.

## 3.2. Workshop 2 RNN for Multiclassification

This workshop is about Recurrent Neural Networks for NLP for detecting emotions in a multi-class dataset. This workshop is self-contained from the first and covers RNNs from the ground up!

## 3.3. Workshop 3 Seq2Seq for Machine Translation

Language Translation is a ubiquitous topic of Modern Natural Language Processing, and the AI that powers language translation is critical to creating a world where we can break down communication barriers between communities that speak different languages.

By the end of this workshop, you'll have a working Language Translation model similar to Google Translate!

# 4. Resources

- [Melanie Walsh Text Analysis Tutorial](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/05-Text-Analysis/04-Sentiment-Analysis.html#) is a great scaffolding for our first workshop.
- [NeuromatchAcademy's Text Analysis Tutorial](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content-dl/tree/main/tutorials) provides another skeleton for our first workshop.
- [Arth's Colab Notebooks](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y7R_lD8-OAyMD6oecoShiDl23ke5Nai0) is the 3rd reference for a table of contents for our first workshop.
