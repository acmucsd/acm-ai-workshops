# 1. Introduction to AI and Neural Networks

Welcome to the repo for ACM AI's first workshop on AI and Neural Networks, hosted in fall 2020

Here's a quick run down of what was in the workshop!

1. What is AI?
2. Stats and history of AI
3. What is AI all about? Is it just Neural Networks? (answer is no)
4. Applications
5. What is a Neural Network? 
6. What is a Neuron? Biologically and Computationally?
7. Weights and Biases of a Network
8. Activation Functions
9. Linear vs Nonlinear activations
10. Vectorized Inputs and implementations
11. Resources

In this folder there is also code for various work we demoed in the workshop. We use the `numpy` package to do our demos. To download it, do
```
pip install numpy
```
