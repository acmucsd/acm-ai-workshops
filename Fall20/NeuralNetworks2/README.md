# Neural Networks Workshop 2 - Weight For it!

This is all about learning in neural networks

Previously we looked at how to create one and individually enter the weights and biases ourselves

These are the slides for this workshop: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z5EzIUjgQvysiJxWwhJiOuM2Sq6ZLuiZKoyoNEfcows/edit?usp=sharing

The Agenda:

1. A brief review of the (vectorized) neural network
2. Motivation for gradient descent
3. Intuitive visual explanation of gradient descent
4. Gradient descent formulated mathematically
5. Motivation for backpropagation
6. Backpropagation calculations
7. Code implementation
8. Live demo of learning
9. Questions
